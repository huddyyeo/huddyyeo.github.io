My name is Hudson Yeo, I'm currently living in the United Kingdom but I'm from sunny Singapore. 
I'm currently at [Wayve](https://wayve.ai) in London working on fun autonomous driving stuff!

Research interests
======

My work focuses a lot on computer vision models. I'm in the World Models team at Wayve so a lot of my work revolves around improving representation learning for embodied AI. 
I've had a great time working on image segmentation, depth estimation, self-supervised learning and more! Generative AI is a huge interest of mine, and I've been working on diffusion models a lot recently.
